# Cell_Lab_3D

The goal of this project is to provide a game/simulator for creating three-dimensional microorganisms by reworking the genome analog. In other words, the 3D version of the game "Cell Lab".


I don't have time to develop the project in the next few days.
Even small recommendations can help the development of the project.
Therefore, I am waiting for intusiasts with any experience or intentions. 

A satisfactory result of this project will be the creation of a prototype of the game by the joint efforts of volunteers or drawing the attention of game studios to the need to create this product.
